# Celebrations & Holidays

> Korea officially follows the Gregorian calendar, even though there are few holidays that are based on the lunar calendar.
> These fall by consequent on different days on the Gregorian calendar every year.
> The most important holidays are 설날 (Seollal - Lunar New Year's Day) and 추석 (Chuseok - Korean Thanksgiving Day), during which 3 (three) days off are granted, allowing Koreans to be with their families in their home town and carry out the traditional rites for the ancestors.  
> During these holidays, offices and banks are closed but most of the businesses and public facilities (museum, department stores, ...) remain open.
